# Project Goals
- Create a Voxel World, build with friends, and publish it
- Players can visit other people’s worlds and be given build permissions
- Focus on making it a relaxed environment to hang out and chill
- Use the voxel world assets from BW2 (lots of art to re-use!)
- Players can fly and are in a “creative mode”
- Publish your world to get a world code. In Editor, you can then load the world by code. This creates a UGC loop where players can design worlds and devs can create games using their worlds.
    - Add some tooling to define string:position pairs for the world. Devs can use these to determine things like spawn locations.
- If enough time, add some building tools. Paint brushes, fill regions, etc.
